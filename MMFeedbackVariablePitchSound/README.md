This feedback extends the normal MMFeedbackSound and MMF_Sound class

To use, make sure to create a Float Variable scriptableObject, and hook it to the feedback's Variable Pitch.

Ensure that you have created an animation curve as well, and set it to the linear ascending/descending curve.

Highly recommended to use a proper ScriptableObject system as such as Scriptable Object Architecture by Everland Games, based on, Ryan Hipple's 2017 Unity Talk.

This code is a meant for a personal game , so I won't be supporting it much.
